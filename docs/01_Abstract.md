# ** Semester Project - II : YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis **  

**Domain:** Natural Language Processing (NLP)  

**Application:** Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments  

**Expected Algorithm / Processing:**  
- Extraction of comments using the YouTube Data API  
- Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob  
- Categorization of comments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral  

**Expected Output from Project:**  
- Visualization of sentiment distribution  
- Identification of dominant sentiment in YouTube videos  
- Display of analyzed comments with sentiment classification  

## **Abstract**  
The **YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis System** is a web-based application that extracts comments from YouTube videos and classifies them into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments. The system leverages the **YouTube Data API** to fetch comments and utilizes **TextBlob**, a rule-based NLP library, to analyze sentiment polarity. The project aims to provide insights into audience engagement by evaluating the emotional tone of comments.  

This system is beneficial for **content creators, brands, and researchers** to assess public opinion on videos, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis models that use complex deep learning architectures, this project follows a **rule-based approach**, ensuring simplicity and ease of deployment. Future enhancements may include **Machine Learning-based sentiment models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)** for improved accuracy.
