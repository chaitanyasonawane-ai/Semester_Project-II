# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in machine learning projects, especially for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis. It helps us understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect issues, and guide preprocessing strategies.

## 1. Dataset Used

The dataset consists of YouTube comments and their corresponding sentiment labels:
- **Comment**: The text input from a user on a video.
- **Sentiment**: A label indicating if the comment is *Positive*, *Negative*, or *Neutral*.

The data was sourced from open platforms like Kaggle or collected via the YouTube Data API and manually annotated.

## 2. Goals of EDA

- Understand the **distribution of sentiment classes**
- Identify **frequently used words** in each class
- Analyze the **length and structure of comments**
- Detect and clean **noise** in the text (stopwords, emojis, links, etc.)
- Decide on appropriate **feature extraction techniques**
